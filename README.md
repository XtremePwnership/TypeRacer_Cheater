# TypeRacer_Cheater
Simple python script using Selenium to cheat at typeracer.com

Download the typeracer.py file & run it, that's it! (ensure to put chromedriver.exe in C:\Windows:\system32 before running though)

Download chromedriver.exe from here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

Now if someone can help in bypassing their captcha test, that would be great. :P
